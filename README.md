# Covid-Tracker-WorldMap
This is a project that tracks Covid cases all over the world and displays it in a world map.
This project uses one of the most interesting property of JavaScript, which is MapBox. This feature displays a map on your website and you can work with it as you want.
I have attached a JSON file along with the repository that consists of live data feed of Covid cases all over world and has been marked all over the world map. 
One can download all the source code and use it accordingly. You can also manipulate different features of MapBox and make your project even more interesting and impactful
